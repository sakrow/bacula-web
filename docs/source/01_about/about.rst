About Bacula-Web
================

Bacula-Web is a php web based tool that provide you a summarized view of jobs, pools and volumes.Its obtain his information from your bacula catalog's database.

This tool provide you informations on the last day jobs status, medias and pool usage, catalog size usage, etc.
All features are described in the :ref:`about/features` page.

The main advantages of this tool are

   * it's web based, so you can reach it simply through your preferred browser from anywhere
   * it's easy to install (you just need a LAMP server with a valid database connection)
   * it contain a lot of information into a single page (have a look on your last jobs for example)

and what's not ?

If you're looking for a tool able to manage Bacula like bat, you're in the wrong place (for the moment).
Maybe have a look on bweb, webacula or the bacula's webmin plugin.

About Bacula
============

Bacula is a set of Open Source, enterprise ready, computer programs that permit you (or the system administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer data across a network of computers of different kinds. Bacula is relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many advanced storage management features that make it easy to find and recover lost or damaged files. In technical terms, it is an Open Source, enterprise ready, network based backup program (source `www.bacula.org`_).

For my point of view, bacula is the best open source backup software I ever used (for professional and private purpose)

About myself
============

I've discovered Linux with `Slackware`_ maybe around 1995 ( I know, I'm an old guy).
Since this time, I had some experiences with

   * Enterprise oriented linux distros
   * Database such as MySQL, postGreSQL, Oracle, etc...
   * Backup solution (both proprietary and open source solutions)
   * Security skills
   * Networking skills
   * Programming (Javascript, PHP, C++, Pascal, bash, perl, etc.)

And many more stuff that I'll not describe there (it's not a resume, it's just a simple presentation about myself ;)

My preferred Linux distros is `Gentoo`_ and I use `Centos`_ for labs, development and testing
